Avianca Coleman — Cybersecurity Portfolio
Defensive Security • Cloud Security • Detection Engineering • SIEM Analysis

Welcome.
This repository contains a curated collection of technical cybersecurity projects that demonstrate my capabilities in detection engineering, SOC analysis, cloud security, and threat-driven defensive work.
The work here reflects my operational style: structured, precise, methodical, and oriented toward real-world security operations.

🛡️ Focus Areas
SOC Operations & Incident Analysis
Cloud Security (AWS)
SIEM Engineering (ELK & Splunk)
Detection Rule Development
Threat Analysis & MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Incident Response Playbooks & Procedures
My portfolio highlights both technical depth and the ability to communicate findings clearly — a key skill for security operations roles.

📁 Repository Overview
/SIEM-Dashboards
Dashboards and visualizations created in ELK and Splunk.
Includes log parsing, query design, filters, correlation logic, and screenshots demonstrating event visibility and investigative insights.
/Investigations
Practical security investigations modeled after real SOC workflows.
Includes triage steps, log sources, event correlation, escalation decisions, and recommended Tier II follow-up actions.
/Cloud-Security-Labs
Hands-on AWS labs demonstrating security design, hardening, and detection.
Includes IAM analysis, S3 security posture assessments, CloudTrail monitoring, misconfiguration simulations, and remediation documentation.
/Detection-Rules
Custom detection rules written in YAML with clear descriptions, detection logic, ATT&CK technique mapping, and example logs.
Designed for ELK, Splunk, or general SIEM use.
/Playbooks
Incident response playbooks covering authentication anomalies, suspicious script activity, privilege escalation, cloud threat scenarios, and standard SOC procedures.

🧪 Core Tools & Technologies
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
Splunk
Sysmon + Windows Event Logs
AWS IAM, S3, CloudTrail
YAML Detection Writing
MITRE ATT&CK
Python (utility and parsing)

🌑 Professional Summary
I specialize in defensive cybersecurity with strengths in cloud security, SIEM engineering, and security operations.
My work is hands-on, evidence-driven, and aligned with modern detection and response practices.
I am building expertise that supports both enterprise security operations and my long-term goal of launching Moon Veil Security, a global cybersecurity company focused on precision, intelligence-driven defense, and high-tier client protection.
